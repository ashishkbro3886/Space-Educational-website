            <li style="margin: 20px;"><mark>Artemis I:</mark> Artemis I, formerly Exploration Mission-1,will be the first integrated flight test of NASA’s Deep Space Exploration Systems:
                 the Orion spacecraft, Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, with the newly upgraded Exploration Ground Systems at Kennedy Space 
                 Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.

                The primary operations goal of the mission is to assure a safe crew module entry, descent, splashdown, and recovery. 
                In addition to sending Orion on its journey around the Moon, SLS will carry 10 small satellites that will perform
                 their own science and technology investigations. The first in a series of increasingly complex missions, Artemis 
                 I will provide a foundation for human deep space exploration and demonstrate our commitment
                 and capability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II.

            <li style="margin: 20px;">
                <mark> Webb Telescope Overview:</mark> The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called JWST or Webb) will be a large infrared 
                telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror. The telescope will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in 2021. 

                The Webb telescope will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. 
                It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang,
                 to the formation
                 of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.

            <li style="margin: 20px;">
                <mark>Juno:</mark> On August 5, 2011, NASA’s Juno spacecraft embarked on a 5-year journey to our solar system's largest planet – 
                the gas giant Jupiter. Its mission: to probe beneath the planet's dense clouds and answer questions about the origin 
                and evolution of Jupiter, our solar system, and giant planets in general across the cosmos. Juno arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 
                2016, after a 5-year, 1.7-billion-mile journey, and settled 
                into a 53-day polar orbit stretching from just above Jupiter’s cloud tops to the outer reaches of the Jovian magnetosphere.
                Now in its extended mission, the agency’s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system’s 
                largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft’s end of life. The extended mission’s science campaigns
                 expand on discoveries Juno has already made about Jupiter’s interior structure, internal magnetic field, atmosphere 
                 (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere. Jupiter’s enigmatic Great Blue Spot – 
                 an isolated patch of intense magnetic field near the planet’s equator – is the target of a high-spatial-resolution 
                 magnetic survey during six flybys early in the extended mission.

                <mark>Mars Perseverance Mission:</mark> The Mars Perseverance rover mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term
                 effort of robotic exploration of the Red Planet. The Mars Perseverance mission addresses high-priority science goals
                  for Mars exploration, including key questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step
                   by not only seeking signs of habitable conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past
                    microbial life itself. The Mars Perseverance rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most
                     promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" on the surface of Mars. 

                The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges 
                of future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere,
                 identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, 
                 dust, and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.

                <mark>Parker Solar Probe:</mark> In order to unlock the mysteries of the Sun's atmosphere, Parker Solar Probe uses Venus’ gravity 
                during seven flybys over nearly seven years to gradually bring its orbit closer to the Sun. The spacecraft will fly 
                through the Sun’s atmosphere as close as 3.8 million miles to our star’s surface, well within the orbit of Mercury 
                and more than seven times closer than any spacecraft has come before. (Earth’s average distance to the Sun is 93 million miles.)

                Flying into the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, for the first time, Parker Solar Probe 
                employs a combination of in situ measurements and imaging to revolutionize our understanding of the corona and expand 
                our knowledge of the origin and evolution of the solar wind. It also makes critical contributions to our ability to 
                forecast changes in Earth's space environment that affect life and technology on Earth.

                <mark>Quesst Mission:</mark> NASA's aeronautical innovators are leading a government-industry team to collect data that could make 
                supersonic flight over land possible, dramatically reducing travel time in the United States or anywhere in the world.

                The Quesst mission has two goals: 1) design and build NASA’s X-59 research aircraft with technology that reduces the 
                loudness of a sonic boom to a gentle thump to people on the ground; and 2) fly the X-59 over select U.S. communities
                 to gather data on human responses to the sound generated during supersonic flight and deliver that data set to U.S. 
                 and international regulators.
                
                Using this data, new sound-based rules regarding supersonic flight over land can be written and adopted, which would 
                open the doors to new commercial cargo and passenger markets to provide faster-than-sound air travel.
