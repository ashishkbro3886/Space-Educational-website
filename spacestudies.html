        <h3 class="one" style="color: cornflowerblue;" style="margin: 20px;">Throughout human history, astronomers have helped people understand what they see in the night sky.
             These famous astronomers — many of them great scientists who mastered many fields — 
             explained space phenomena with varying degrees of accuracy. 

            Over the centuries, a geocentric view of the universe — with Earth at the center of everything — 
            gave way to the proper understanding we have today of an expanding universe in which our galaxy is but one of billions. 
            On this list are some of the most famous scientists from the early days of astronomy through the modern era, 
            and a summary of some of their achievements.

            <p>In ancient Greece, astronomer and mathematician Claudius Ptolemy (A.D. 90–168) set up a model of the solar system in 
                which the sun, stars, and other planets revolved around Earth. Known as the Ptolemaic system, it remained in place 
                for hundreds of years, though it turned out to be flat wrong.</p>
            <p>According to NASA(opens in new tab), "Ptolemy represents the epitome of knowledge of Grecian astronomy." 
                As a mathematician, geographer and astronomer, he authored several scientific texts which had considerable 
                impact on Western intellectual thought.
            </p>   
            <p>
                In the 2nd century, Ptolemy published the Almagest(opens in new tab), a comprehensive treatise on the movements 
                of the stars and planets. It expanded Hipparchus’ geometric model of celestial motions, utilizing epicycles and 
                eccentric circles in a geocentric theory which placed the Earth at the center of the solar system. This Ptolemaic 
                system presented tables of information allowing convenient predictions of planetary locations. Ptolemy also catalogued 
                48 constellations, the names of which are still in use at present.

                Ptolemy's writings stood as authoritative for more than 1,200 years. However, his model, which was incorrect, 
                later fell out of use as the heliocentric view of the solar system came into being.

            <p>
                In 16th century Poland, astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) proposed a model of the solar system that 
                involved the Earth revolving around the sun, according to NASA.(opens in new tab) The model wasn't completely 
                correct, as astronomers of the time struggled with the backwards path Mars sometimes took, but it eventually 
                changed the way many scientists viewed the solar system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Copernicus, of Poland, felt the Ptolemaic view of the planets traveling in circular orbits around the Earth was 
                over-complicated with many smaller circles, epicycles, needed to explain the intermittent retrograde motion of 
                the planets (in which they appear to move in the opposite direction of the the stars). Copernicus published his 
                book, De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium ("On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres(opens in new tab)") when he 
                was 70 and lay dying.
            </p>
            <p>
                His ideas took almost a hundred years to gain credence, but Galileo's 1632 assertions that the Earth orbited the 
                sun built upon the Polish astronomer's work, cementing the Copernican revolution.

            JOHANNES KEPLER

        <h3 style="margin: 20px;">
            <p>Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630)
             determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles, as Copernicus had thought, but in ellipses. In so doing,
              he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today. However, 
              closed minds put Kepler's work at risk. 

            Kepler defended and modified the Copernican view of the solar system with a radical reformation that established him 
            as one of the great lights of the Scientific Revolution of the 16th-17th centuries.</p>
            <p>
                Kepler's deduction that the planets travel elliptical orbits, with the sun at one of the foci formed his first planetary 
                law, which he published in 1609 with the second law which stated that planets do not travel at the same rate throughout 
                their orbits.

                Kepler's third law, published a decade later, posited that the relationship between the length of two planets' orbits is related to 
                their distances from the sun. Though he made other contributions to mathematics and optics, Kepler's three laws made him a giant of 
                astronomy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                "The era in which Kepler lived was one of tremendous upheaval and change," said Dan Lewis, curator of the history of 
                science and technology at the Huntington Library in San Marino, Calif. "Religious leaders were reluctant to relinquish 
                their ideas about the heavens. 

                Talk by astronomers of a sky filled with objects moving in non-circular orbits and other phenomena that went against 
                an Earth-centric model threatened their beliefs. As a result, Kepler and his first wife, Barbara, created a code with 
                which to write letters to each other so that their correspondence would not put them at risk of persecution."

                Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. 

                According to the Rice University's Galileo Project(opens in new tab), "Galileo made his first telescope in 1609, modeled after 
                telescopes produced in other parts of Europe that could magnify objects three times. He created a telescope later that same year 
                that could magnify objects twenty times." The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new 
                observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean 
                moons), as well as the rings of Saturn(opens in new tab). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became 
                widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated 
                the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it.

                Galileo, born in Pisa, Italy, also made numerous scientific discoveries. He famously proved that all falling bodies 
                fall at the same rate, regardless of mass. Further he developed the first pendulum clock.

                Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomenon 
                that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first 
                observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its largest moon, Titan.

                Developing improved telescopes, Huygens was able to make several important astronomical discoveries. It was in 1655 that 
                he proposed that a thin, flat ring circled Saturn. His discovery of Titan marked the first moon spotted around the planet. 
                He made the first known drawing of the Orion Nebula.

                Elsewhere in his research, Huygens proposed a wave theory of light, which was disputed by Newton, who preferred the 
                particle theory. The modern theory of light combines the two into a wave-particle duality model.

                Recently, Huygens' legacy was commemorated in the probe named after him, which parachuted on Titan in 2005.

            ISAAC NEWTON

            <p>
                English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. 
                Building on the work of those who had gone before him — he is quoted as saying, "If I have seen further, it is by 
                standing upon the shoulders of giants" — he calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, 
                known today as Newton's laws.

                The well-known Newtonian laws of motion are: 1) an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in uniform 
                motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force. 2) The net force on an object is 
                equal to the rate of change of its linear momentum in an inertial reference frame, or if a body is accelerating, 
                there a force is acting on it. 3) For every action there is an equal and opposite action.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a story that has long since gone into the public consciousness, Newton supposedly found inspiration for his theory 
                of gravitation upon seeing an apple fall from a tree. From this he conjectured that gravity's pull could extend outwards 
                from the earth, even as far as the moon and further.

                Newton often commands respect as the most influential figure in all of science. He invented calculus, as well as 
                investigating optics, mechanics, experimental chemistry, alchemy, and theology. His creation of the three universal 
                laws of motion plus the invention of the theory of universal gravity permanently altered the field of science.

                Newton's achievements have been celebrated in many ways, with statues and poems. Notably the unit for force was named 
                for him, the newton (N).

                French astronomer Charles Messier (1730–1817) composed a database of objects known at the time as "nebulae," which 
                included 103 objects at its final publication, though additional objects were added based on his personal notes. 
                Many of these objects are often listed with their catalog name, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, known as M31. 
                Messier also discovered 13 comets over the course of his lifetime.

                Born in France, Messier developed an interest in astronomy at an early age, having witnessed a 6-tailed comet at age 
                14 in 1744. Further he viewed an annular solar eclipse in 1748.

                As a young comet hunter, he began to discover and note nebulas, as these frequently were confused for comets. Thus began his

                eventually expanded by Messier to 103 objects (though there is a debate about M102). Later astronomers filled out the 
                catalog to a total of 110 objects. Today Messier's catalog is still used widely, though because of his location in France, 
                he only included Northern Hemisphere sky objects.

            Before Cannon, stars were classified alphabetically, from A to Q, based on their temperatures. Cannon realized that a

            linked in an entity known as space-time, which is distorted by gravity.

            American astronomer Harlow Shapley (1885–1972) calculated the size of the Milky Way galaxy and general location of 
            its center. He argued that the objects known as "nebulae" lay within the galaxy, rather than outside of it, and 
            incorrectly disagreed with Hubble's observations that the universe boasted galaxies other than the Milky Way.

            Frank Drake (born 1930) is one of the pioneers in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. He was one of the 
            founders of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and devised the Drake equation, a mathematical equation 
            used to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy able to be detected.

            <p>American astronomer Carl Sagan (1934–1996) may not have been a great scientist in comparison to some on this list, 
            but he is one of the most famous astronomers. Sagan not only made important scientific studies in the fields of planetary 
            science, he also managed to popularize astronomy, according to NASA Science. 

            His charismatic teaching and boundless energy influenced people around the world as he broke down complicated subjects in a 
            way that interested television viewers even as he educated them. Sagan founded the Planetary Society(opens in new tab), a 
            nonprofit organization devoted to advancing space science and exploration.</p>
            <p>
                Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York. He served as professor of astronomy and space sciences, and director of the Laboratory for Planetary 
                Studies at Cornell University. He made many scientific discoveries, including explaining the high temperatures of Venus and the 
                seasonal changes on Mars.

                However, Sagan's most known contribution to astronomy was as a educator and popularizer of science. He published 
                numerous articles and books, including "Cosmos(opens in new tab)," which became a television show viewed by a billion 
                people in sixty countries. As host of the show, he even spawned his own catchphrase — the oft-parodied “billions and 
                billions” — based on his distinctive inflection, though he never uttered that phrase during the show. Sagan also penned 
                the science-fiction novel “Contact(opens in new tab), later adapted into a motion picture starring Jodie Foster. 
                Many tributes and memorials were dedicated to Sagan following his death, illustrating how deeply his persona pervaded 
                the cultural landscape.

            American astronomer William K. Hartmann (born 1939) put forth the most widely accepted theory on the formation of the 
            moon in 1975. 

            He proposed that, after a collision with a large body scooped, debris from the Earth coalesced into the moon.

            STEPHEN HAWKING

                Stephen Hawking (1942– 2018) made many significant insights into the field of cosmology. He proposed that, as the 
                universe has a beginning, it will likely also end. He also suggested that it has no boundary or border. 

                Despite being viewed as one of the most brilliant minds since Einstein, many of Hawking's books and lectures(opens in new tab) 
                 steered toward the general public as he seeks to educate people about the universe they live in.

                A theoretical physicist and cosmologist, Hawking was considered one of the greatest scientific minds since Einstein. 
                Although motor neurone disease related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease) hobbled him since the 
                age of 20, Hawking completed his doctorate in cosmology at Cambridge.

                Hawking's primary discovery stated that since the universe began (at the Big Bang), it must come to an end. 
                Hawking demonstrated (with Roger Penrose) that since Einstein’s general theory of relativity suggested that space 
                and time began at the birth of the universe, and ends within black holes. This results unites general relativity and 
                quantum theory. Further, Hawking predicted that black holes do emit radiation, called Hawking radiation.

                Hawking wrote about these and other discoveries in several books, including the best-seller A Brief History of Time
                (opens in new tab). His wheelchair-bound appearance and his speech-synthesized voice (he is now completely paralyzed) 
                are familiar to the public from appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation, The Simpsons, Futurama, and The Big Bang 
                Theory.
